## üí° Features and goals

### Hands-on, project based

[We believe in learning by building](https://blog.boot.dev/about). We mix guided and unguided content. Every *guided course* is a collection of coding assignments and quizzes designed to teach a set of concepts. Every *unguided project* is a blueprint for students to build an entire application on their local machines.

### Linear curriculum

The majority of students should have a *simple and straight* path to completion, without needing to make many choices about which courses to take next.

### Modern tech stack

The tech stack should be *fairly* lean. The goal of Boot.dev is to teach the *concepts* of CS without *forcing* students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Boot.dev are currently:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Go

### Should I get started even though the program is not "complete"?

**Yes you should get started - this program will always be improving and never be "complete".** This curriculum will never be "complete" in the same sense the YouTube will never be "complete" - there is new content all the time. We care deeply about the quality of this program and will always be improving and adding to it.
