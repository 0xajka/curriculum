### üìù Notes

One goal is to keep the curriculum as linear as possible. We want the majority of students to be given a simple path to completion, without needing to make too many choices between classes. That said, electives and bonus courses are and will always be a part of Qvault.

We want to keep the tech stack *fairly* lean. In other words, the goal is to teach the concepts of CS without forcing students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Qvault are currently:

* JavaScript
* Go
* Python

## üëè Contribute

We love help and feedback on how we can improve the curriculum! If you're confident in your suggestions feel free to fork the repo and open pull requests to the `main` branch. Otherwise, if you're less sure, feel free to open issues here on Github. Lastly, if you just want to talk about some ideas, use the discussions tab or contact us directly usingg one of the methods below.
