# Qvault's Computer Science Curriculum

This is my roadmap for [Qvault's free-to-audit computer science program](https://qvault.io). 

* Courses with links have already been released
* All courses are free to read and interact with in a "coding sandbox"
* Hit the project with a star if you find it useful ‚≠ê
* Please leave feedback in the form of issues here on Github

### üìù Notes

One goal is to keep the curriculum as linear as possible. I want the majority of students to be given a *simple* path to completion, without needing to make too many choices between classes. That said, electives and bonus courses are and will always be a part of Qvault.

I want to keep the tech stack *fairly* lean. In other words, the goal is to teach the concepts of CS without forcing students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Qvault are currently:

* JavaScript
* Go
* Python

## üëè Contribute

I love help and feedback on how I can improve the curriculum! The recommended way to help is to submit issues here on Github. If you just want to talk about some ideas, use the discussions tab or contact me directly using one of the methods below.
