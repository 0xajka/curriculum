# Qvault's Computer Science Curriculum

This is the roadmap for [Qvault's free-to-audit computer science program](https://qvault.io). 

* Courses with links have already been released
* All courses are free to audit, meaning you can read all the material and interact within a "coding sandbox"
* Hit the project with a star if you find it useful ‚≠ê
* Please leave feedback in the form of issues here on Github

## An Online Unaccredited CS Degree

### üí° Features and goals

#### Linear Curriculum

The majority of students should have a *simple and straight* path to completion, without needing to make many choices about which courses to take. That said, electives and bonus courses are and will always be a part of Qvault.

#### Tech stack

The tech stack should be *fairly* lean. The goal of Qvault is to teach the *concepts* of CS without *forcing* students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Qvault are currently:

* JavaScript
* Go
* Python

## üëè Contribute

I love help and feedback on how I can improve the curriculum! The recommended way to help is to submit issues here on Github. If you just want to talk about some ideas, use the discussions tab or contact me directly using one of the methods below.
