## Philosophy

*You can read about our [approach to learning here](https://blog.boot.dev/about/), but in a nutshell we believe:*

1. Coding is fun, don‚Äôt make it dull
2. Computer science matters, degrees don‚Äôt
3. You need to build
4. You need to deploy
5. It‚Äôs hard to find good resources, so cherish the ones you find
6. Learning to code is a depth-first algorithm
7. Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint
8. You should be uncomfortable, you'll learn faster if you're pushing yourself
9. Get an on-site, full-time job for yhour first job if possible

## Should I start learning even though the program is not "complete"?

**Yes you should get started - this program will always be improving and never be "complete".** This curriculum will never be "complete" in the same sense the YouTube will never be "complete" - there is new content all the time. We care deeply about the quality of this program and will always be improving and adding to it.
