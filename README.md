## Philosophy

You can read about our [approach to learning here](https://blog.boot.dev/about/).

## Should I start learning even though the program is not "complete"?

**Yes you should get started - this program will always be improving and never be "complete".** This curriculum will never be "complete" in the same sense the YouTube will never be "complete" - there is new content all the time. We care deeply about the quality of this program and will always be improving and adding to it.

## üëè Contribute

We love feedback on how we can improve the curriculum! The recommended way to help is to submit issues here on GitHub. If you just want to talk about some ideas, contact us directly using one of the methods below.
