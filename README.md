# Qvault's Computer Science Curriculum

This is the roadmap for [Qvault's free-to-audit computer science program](https://qvault.io). 

* Courses with links have already been released
* All courses are free to audit, meaning you can read all the material and interact within a "coding sandbox"
* Hit the project with a star if you find it useful ‚≠ê
* Please leave feedback in the form of issues here on Github

## An Online Unaccredited CS Degree

1. [Basic Intro to Coding (JavaScript)](https://qvault.io/basic-intro-to-coding-course/)
2. [Basic Intro to Coding 2 (JavaScript)](https://qvault.io/basic-intro-to-coding-course/)

### üí° Features and goals

#### Linear Curriculum

The majority of students should have a *simple and straight* path to completion, without needing to make many choices about which courses to take. That said, electives and bonus courses are and will always be a part of Qvault.

#### Tech stack

The tech stack should be *fairly* lean. The goal of Qvault is to teach the *concepts* of CS without *forcing* students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Qvault are currently:

* JavaScript
* Go
* Python

### Tracks

In an effort to make Qvault's courses also useful in more bite-size chunks, we offer shorter "tracks" of courses for those who don't need a full CS program.

* [Algorithms and Data Structures Track](ALGOS_DS_TRACK.md)
* [Gopher Gang Track](GOPHER_GANG_TRACK.md)
* [Front-end Web Track](FRONT_END_WEB_TRACK.md)
* [Back-end Web Track](BACK_END_WEB_TRACK.md)
