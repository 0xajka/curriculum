# Boot.dev's Computer Science Curriculum for Backend Developers

‚≠ê Hit the project with a star if you find it useful! ‚≠ê

This is a living roadmap for [Boot.dev's free-to-audit computer science program for backend developers.](https://boot.dev)

## FAQ

### Where is the HTML, CSS & React?

**This is not a front-end program.** That said, we've had front-end engineers who still complete the courses and projects for the sake of learning the computer science content. However, we have no immediate plans for front-end technologies in this curriculum.

### Can I skip ahead?

**You shouldn't skip ahead unless you really know what you are doing**. Some people are compfortable skipping the first course, "Learn to Code in JavaScript" because it is for beginners. Almost nothing else should be skipped because the rest of the content builds upon itself.

### Do I need to learn JavaScript, Python and Go?

**Yes, learning several programming languages is critical to your success.** It's not nearly as hard to pick up a second programming language after you're familiar with your first one, yet it offers many benefits. You can [read more here](https://blog.boot.dev/education/learn-multiple-programming-languages) if you're skeptical.

### Should I get started even though the program is not "complete"?

**Yes you should get started.** This curriculum will never be "complete" in the same sense the YouTube will never be "complete" - there is new content daily. We care deeply about the quality of this program and will always be improving and adding to it.

### Will Boot.dev help my find my first job?

**We help you prepare for your first development job, but we won't match you with a company**. We go one step further than universities. We provide education about how to be a backend developer and education about how to find a job. That said, we don't actually do the "finding" for you.

### Is Boot.dev free?

The first two chapters of every course are free. After that, it's only free to read, and we call this read-only mode "sandbox mode". In sandbox mode, you won't be able to pass off assignments without [becoming a patron](https://boot.dev/pricing) in order to support development.

## The Roadmap of Courses and Projects

**IMPORTANT NOTE: We are in the middle of some big changes to the order of the curriculum at the moment. The new curriculum starts with Python instead of JavaScript. This allows us to teach some more advanced JS concepts, but also makes the beginning of the program smoother and easier for students. The change should be done within the week.**

### üí° Features and goals

#### Hands-on, project based

[We believe in learning by building](https://blog.boot.dev/about). We mix guided and unguided content. Every *guided course* is a collection of coding assignments and quizzes designed to teach a set of concepts. Every *unguided project* is a blueprint for students to build entire applications on their local machines which teaches practicality.

#### Linear curriculum

The majority of students should have a *simple and straight* path to completion, without needing to make many choices about which courses to take.

#### Modern tech stack

The tech stack should be *fairly* lean. The goal of Boot.dev is to teach the *concepts* of CS without *forcing* students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Boot.dev are currently:

* JavaScript
* Go
* Python
